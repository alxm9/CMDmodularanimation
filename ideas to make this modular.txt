how can I make this modular?

pseudo of how the function would be run:


bg.color = green
bg.z_level = 0

element1.color = red
element.z_level = 1

elemenet2.color = blue
element.z_level = 2

animation(bg, element1, element2)

-LISTS!!

spritesheet1 = ["1.txt", "2.txt", "3.txt", "4.txt"]
spritesheet2 = ["1.txt", "2.txt", "3.txt", "4.txt"]
spritesheet3 = ["1.txt", "2.txt", "3.txt", "4.txt"]

Loop:
	if cursor_position_spritesheet1[0] exists and nothing in same position of ss2[0] and ss3[0]:
		print(cursor_position_spritesheet1[0])
	if something in same position:
		check_z levels
		print whatever has the higher zlevel
	everything is printed according to the color and zlevel

If I manage to pull this off then I could theoretically have as many enemies as I want on the screen.
	!!! However, for this to work, I should also consider how to move things around on the screen and not be 	constrained by having the original sprites in a given position (LATER)

What about if two different sprite sheets have a different amount of frames? How am I going to handle that? (now that I think of it, the background does have one frame..)

The sprites shouldn't all be the same size, that's pretty cheap. (LATER)

to do list:
	-MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS MODULAR AND NOT HARDCODED 
	-take zlevels from each object => placed in obj:zlevel dictionaries for the time being
	-loop through every letter of each frame simoultaneously
	-conditions on which letter to print

Fuck it, let's try hardcoding it first and see how it goes and if I can convert it to something more modular

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I need to make a dictionary where the chars are connected to their respective z-levels

Ok so I managed to implement zlevels properly and I can add as many spritesheets as I want.
It looks hella nice ngl

Code's starting to look like shit. I should consider if I can make use of classes here.
